One late night stranded in an airport coming home for Christmas,
I decided to make a clone of an old DOS game I loved as a kid. I had just
learned linear algebra, so I wanted to make use of that. Also allegro.
Also C.

It's kind of like an unholy frankenstein monster, but it seems to work.
I remember there's a way to configure the board to make an infinite loop,
but I don't remember what the secret is.

If you're an employer, you're not allowed to judge me on this =)
